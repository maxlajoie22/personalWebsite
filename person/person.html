            <h1>Sports</h1>
            <p>Growing up, I played a lot of sports. Some of my personal favorites are football and basketball, but I really love anything active.
                I do get a little bit too competitive though. I play to win every time and I will target your knee.

        <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
        <p>My first experience with coding was in 4th grade when I first discovered Scratch. I will enjoyed it but I didn't 
            rekindle the flame until junior year of high school where I begun to build simple coding projects. Now, I study computer
            science and ACMS at the University of Notre Dame and have built many projects. <strong>If you want to check them out then
